# WGU D277 Front-End Web Development
## Final Performance Assessment, by Dallas Taylor (dtay418)

Hello, and welcome to my Performance Assessment task 2 submission.

Please feel free to examine the site and the source code (and if you have any
helpful comments for becoming a better web designer, please let me know).

If you intend to submit this as your own work, please don't. These submissions
are compared with others for similarity. Please feel free to take a gander
at the work and let me know if you have questions about how I've used something,
or let me know if I used something less efficiently than I should have.

Enjoy!
